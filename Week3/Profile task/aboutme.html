  <h1 class= "one">ABOUT ME</h1>
  <p class= "about">    Hi, I'm Sally Ayebaye, and I graduated from the Rivers State University in 2013 with a degree in Accounting. However, my interests are in Front End Engineering, and I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences.<br><br>

    I previously worked at Logistic Solutions, where I led the database project. Logistic Solutions was a service for companies to make urban transportation expenses convenient. Companies can create employee groups, set ride policies, and share corporate payment methods with their employees.<br><br>

    I built the project with two other engineers. I'm open to taking on other projects as I may deem fit from time to time.</p>
